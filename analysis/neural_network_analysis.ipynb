The incident took place at the Pájaro Azul cooperative, north of Guayaquil, Ecuador, on August 7 during the night.\\n\\nIn the video, you can see a father with his daughter being intercepted by two men on a motorcycle. Violently, they approach the father and one of them gets off the motorcycle to attack him. The assault is such that the offender hit the victim on the head with his firearm.\\n\\nThe father tries to calm the thief, but instead of reassuring him, this provokes the wrath of the assailant, who apparently shoots him in one of his legs. Subsequently, both criminals flee on the motorcycle, leaving behind the man’s belongings.\\n\\nThe girl, seeing her father wounded, begins to cry inconsolably while yelling at him: “Daddy! Help, they shot him!” The little girl’s screams alerted a woman in the nearby house.\\n\\nBoth the minor and the woman panic, requesting help and an ambulance to attend to the situation.\\n\\nThe curious thing is that, despite the assault, the attackers did not take any of the man’s belongings',\n",
